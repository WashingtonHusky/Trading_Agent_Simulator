## Overview

The **Trading Agent Simulator** is an educational framework designed to teach and explore algorithmic trading strategies in a simulated environment. Students can develop their own trading agents, simulate trades using historical stock data, and evaluate the performance of their strategies in a controlled, dynamic setting.

---

## Features

- **Stock Simulation**: Generate synthetic stock price data for multiple assets, stored in CSV format.
- **Agent Framework**: Develop custom trading agents to make buy/sell decisions dynamically.
- **Performance Tracking**: Evaluate agent performance over time, combining cash holdings and portfolio value.
- **Collaborative Learning**: Encourages students to experiment with different strategies and compare results.

---

## Structure

- **`stocks/`**: Contains simulated stock price data for different assets.
- **`agents/`**: A folder for student-created trading agents. Each agent is a Python file implementing a `decide_trades` function.
- **`trading_agent_master.ipynb`**: The main notebook for running simulations and visualizing results.
- **`LICENSE`**: Project license under MIT.
